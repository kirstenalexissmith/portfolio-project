    <h2 class="border">About Me</h2>
    <p><span class="intro">Hello, to anyone reading my page! My name is Kirsten. </span> I am 26 years old, born and
      raised in Oregon. I live in a house in portland with two of my bestfriends, Sami and Kylie. I recently quit my job
      bartending to pursue education in programming. I also dog sit as a side hustle. I am definitely a homebody but
      enjoy going out with friends occasionally. I live life with a very go-with-the-flow, relaxed attitude which keeps
      life enjoyable for me. </p>

    <h2 class="border">My Background</h2>
    <p> For the past 7 years I have worked in the service industry, most recently as a bartender. I also worked as a
      gymnastics coach for about 2 years while bartending. It recently dawned on me that I wanted more for my life, and
      for myself. I quit my last job and started this bootcamp in hopes that is will be a promising career change for
      myself. I always saw videos about people coding and admired them. Time for me to do it for myself! Cheers to this
      new journey! </p>
